# Generic store

<div class="alert">
Work in progress
</div>

If you have specific use cases, e.g. want to implement a `Toast` system or something similar, the generic store will take this much easier.

The modal system uses the generic store, take a look [at the source](https://github.com/jshmrtn/vue-haystack/tree/master/src/modal) if you want to implement your own stores.
